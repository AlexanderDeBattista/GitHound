# GitHound

## Overview

**GitHound** is a BloodHound OpenGraph collector for GitHub, designed to map your organizationâ€™s structure and permissions into a navigable attackâ€‘path graph. It:

- **Models Key GitHub Entities**  
  - **GHOrganization**: Your GitHub org metadata  
  - **GHUser**: Individual user accounts in the org  
  - **GHTeam**: Teams that group users for shared access  
  - **GHRepository**: Repositories within the org  
  - **GHBranch**: Named branches in each repo  
  - **GHOrgRole**, **GHTeamRole**, **GHRepoRole**: Orgâ€‘, teamâ€‘, and repoâ€‘level roles/permissions  

- **Visualize & Analyze in BloodHound**  
  - **Access Audits**: See at a glance who has admin/write/read on repos and branches  
  - **Compliance Checks**: Validate leastâ€‘privilege across teams and repos  
  - **Incident Response**: Trace privilege escalations and group memberships  

With GitHound, you get a clear, interactive graph of your GitHub permissions landscapeâ€”perfect for security reviews, compliance audits, and rapid incident investigations.  

## Collector Setup & Usage

- **Collects via the GitHub API**  
  - Requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) with **`read:org`** and **`repo`** scopes  
  - Fetches org members, teams, repos, branches, and all role assignments  
  - Outputs a BloodHoundâ€‘compatible JSON graph file (`githound_<org>.json`)
